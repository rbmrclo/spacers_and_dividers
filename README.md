# Spacers & Dividers

Spacers and Dividers is my own replacement for ```<hr/>``` and ```<br/>``` with
tags with creative touch that you can also use in your projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'spacers_and_dividers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spacers_and_dividers

## Usage

   Just create a ```<div class='vspacer-[PREFERRED HEIGHT]'></div>``` and the
   wizards will automatically do the spacing.
